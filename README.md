## 📌 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Reinforce Loyalty with Long-Term Contracts**
   - Expand incentives (e.g., discounts or loyalty perks) for customers willing to commit to yearly or two-year plans.

2. **Target Early-Tenure Customers with Onboarding Campaigns**
   - Churn peaks among new users. Introduce onboarding journeys, customer support outreach, or personalized product recommendations in the first 90 days.

3. **Address High-Churn Payment Channels**
   - Customers using **E-Check** are churning at a higher rate. Investigate transaction pain points and promote more stable alternatives like auto-pay or bank transfers.

4. **Leverage Service Combinations to Improve Stickiness**
   - Customers with multiple services (e.g., Internet + Phone + Tech Support) show lower churn. Bundle promotions could increase retention.

5. **Monitor At-Risk Segments Monthly**
   - Set up automated Power BI alerts or dashboards to track churn by tenure and payment method in real-time.
